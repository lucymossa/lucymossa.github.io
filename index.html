            <h2>01 Philips SmartSleep</h2><br><br>
            <p>I ddeveloped this app as an extension of Philips' SmartSleep collection. Unlike their other apps, which have very specific
                    uses like measuring sleep apnea, this application is meant to reach a broader range of customers. Philips SmartSleep helps
                    the user to fall asleep and through the rewards system, conditions them to improve their sleep quality in the long term.
                    Motivation is created by earning points, which can be exchanged against a wide range of products, all of which can be paired
                    with the app such as the Philips Somneo light or even a mattress that slowly rocks the user to sleep. Points are earned
                        every night by sleeping and extra boosts are given out for reaching milestones, like fulfilling a personal sleep goal!

            <h2>02 The Ways in the Willows</h2><br><br>
            <p>The Ways in the Willows is an interactive, online story map based on the story of 'The Wind in the Willows',
                 written by Kenneth Grahame in 1908. The experience allows the user to be introduced to the story by familiarising
                  themselves with the spatial setting. A hidden quiz tests the user's knowledge of the book and shows a reward for
                   successful completion. Scroll down the page to see the images or click on the link for the full experience. 
                   Why donâ€™t you try and see whatâ€™s inside the Mole's house? ðŸ˜‰
